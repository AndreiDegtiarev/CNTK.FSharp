# CNTK.FSharp

Status: experimental

Goal: provide F# utilities to make the CNTK .NET API pleasant to use from the F# scripting environment

Plan: as a first step, focus on replicating the 
[existing C# examples](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/TrainingCSharp), 
to understand better what works and what doesn't. 

Contributing: given the very early stage of the project, I plan on working on experimental branches first, 
and slowly integrate ideas in master. Ideally, if you have ideas, submit them as an issue, linking to your 
branch, so we can start a discussion!
