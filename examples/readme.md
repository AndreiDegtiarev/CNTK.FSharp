# Examples

The examples are converted from the C# examples presented in the CNTK repository.

Each file is intended to be run directly from the Code editor, in the F# scripting environment. Any editor able to run F# scripts should do.

To run an example in Code:

1. Prerequisites: you need to have the Ionide-fsharp extension installed in Code, to run F#, and Ionide-Paket, to download the dependencies via Paket. 
2. Install Paket (command `paket install`), which will download the CNTK library.
3. Select the script you want to run, select all the code (`Ctrl+A`) and send it to the Interactive session for evaluation (`Alt+Enter`).
